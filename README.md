Challenges Faced
One of the challenges during development was styling the social media links in the footer. Initially, the Font Awesome icons were not displaying at the right size, even after using the fa-xl class. After struggling with different approaches, I reached out to my nephew, who helped me identify the issue. We fixed it by properly implementing Font Awesome classes and ensuring that the CSS styles were correctly applied. This experience highlighted the importance of seeking help, troubleshooting effectively, and continuous learning in web development.
